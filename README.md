# Project README

## Introduction

This Node.js API project is designed to provide a robust backend service with various features including authentication, logging, and CRUD operations. The following sections outline the steps for contributing to the project and migrating database/schema changes.

## Default Superadmin Credentials

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

Please ensure to change these credentials in a production environment for security purposes.

## Pull Request (PR) Workflow

Follow these steps to create and merge a PR to the main branch:

1. **Sync with the Latest Code**

   - Run `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge the latest changes from the main branch.

2. **Develop Your Feature/Fix**

   - Work on your code changes in a feature or bugfix branch. Ensure your changes align with the project's goals and coding standards.

3. **Commit Your Changes**

   - Use `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"` to commit your changes. Ensure your commit messages are clear and concise.

4. **Push Your Changes**

   - Push your branch to the remote repository using `git push origin your-branch-name`.

5. **Create a Pull Request**

   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub, and create a PR from your branch to the main branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant context.

6. **Merge the PR (Reviewer)**
   - Once the PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main branch by a designated reviewer.

## Database/Schema Migration

Follow these steps to implement and manage database/schema migrations:

1. **Write Migration Code**

   - Create a migration file in the `src/migrations` directory. Follow the naming convention: `1-add-default-roles.js`.

2. **Backup the Database**

   - Ensure you take a complete backup of the database to prevent data loss.

3. **Run the Migration**

   - Execute the migration with the command `npm run migrate 1-add-default-roles.js`.

4. **Rollback if Necessary**

   - If you encounter issues during migration, use `npm run rollback 1-add-default-roles.js` to revert the changes.

5. **Develop with Care**
   - Ensure the `migrate` and `rollback` methods in your migration file are correctly implemented to handle schema changes safely and effectively.

## Swagger Doc Guidelines

Follow these steps to create swagger doc for each new endpoint:

- Add tag and description if you are creating a new group type. Add tag details in `src/utils/swaggerConfigs/index.js` file under `SWAGGER_TAGS`.

- Create new file for that tag i.e `auth.js` and import it inside `SCHEMA_EXAMPLES` in the same file `src/utils/swaggerConfigs/index.js`.

- Create schema inside the file created `auth.js` in the following format :

```
registerBusiness:{
    body: {},
    params: {},
    response: {}
}
```

- Add the openai comment to your router and import this schema components

**NOTE :** Refer to the `/health-check` api or any auth api for the openai comment format.
